---

## Part 0: Install VSCode
* Follow this link https://code.visualstudio.com/ to find instructions on setting up VSCode on all Operating Systems. 
* Most of the students in CSE15L should have this installed already as CSE8B and CSE11 is a prerequisite, and VSCode is the main preferred text editor. 

## Part 1: Groups, Shared Lab Docs, and Setting up your Lab Account.
* Navigate to this [lab sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xJN0bQ6b0whZwdimxtdBe41Ot-JgnvOJGFEh_VmcXcY/edit#gid=0), then find your specific lab group and time. Introduce yourselves and further instructions will be on the doc. This is where you will screenshot and answer several questions.

**LAB ACCOUNT:** 

* Use this [link](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to find your account. 
*Note that your account will be the three last letters; you will use this in your ssh key.*

* Then use this [link to reset your password](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hs7CyQeh-MdUfM9uv99i8tqfneos6Y8bDU0uhn1wqho/edit); it's a tutorial on how to reset your password. As the doc will reiterate, make sure to not click "Check password" and instead to click on the password itself and hit enter. If you run into trouble with the password, chances are it's too weak.

* After maybe 15 minutes, you should be ready to access your remote server using your SSH key login.
