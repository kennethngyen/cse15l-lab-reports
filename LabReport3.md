# Lab Report 3 by Kenneth Nguyen, PIDA17458399

## We will use `grep` for this Lab Report. In particular, it will be:
1. `grep -h`
2. `grep -l`
3. `grep -r`
4. `grep -c`

## Command 1: `grep -h`
### What it does: 
**`grep -h`:** *displays the matched lines but not the file name itself (per GeeksForGeeks)*



## Command 2: `grep -l`
### What it does: 
**`grep -l`:** *displays the list of file names that include the query keyword (per GeeksForGeeks)*



## Command 3: `grep -r`
### What it does: 
**`grep -r`:** *searches RECURSIVELY (hence the -r) for the line in all files of the directory*


## Command 4: `grep -c`
### What it does: 
**`grep -c`:** *prints the count of lines that match a pattern*
